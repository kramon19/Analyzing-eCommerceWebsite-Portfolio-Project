# Analyzing-eCommerceWebsite-Portfolio-Project
Used MySQL to analyze Maven Fuzzy Factory, an eCommerce start-up, that measures business performance by using SQL tools and techniques such as joins, subqueries,
temporary tables, aggregates functions, CASE statements, and aliases. Performance measures includes:

* Analyzing Traffic Sources & Optimization: Used MySQL to analyze where our website traffic is coming from, how different sources perform in terms of traffic 
  volume and conversion rates, and how we can adjust bids to optimize our budgets.

* Analyzing Website Performance: Used MySQL to build and analyze conversion funnels to help optimize the customer purchase experience.

* Product Analysis: Use MySQL to break down product-level sales and conversion rates, analyze cross-selling patterns, and use refund rates to keep a pulse on 
  quality.

* Seasonal Trends: Used MySQl to analyze business patterns and business performance based on month and year.

* User Analysis: Look at user behavior and repeat sessions, and use MySQL techniques to identify our most valuable customers and explore which channels they 
  are coming from.
